Searching for a file on your computer is a whole

1
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.000
lot easier than digging through a pile of papers,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.130
yet it's far from being a perfect system.

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.180
Have you ever had trouble finding a document

4
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.779
because you can't recall what you named it?

5
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:13.220
If so,

6
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.760
this training is for you.

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.690
Finding a file is a whole lot faster with an organized file system.

8
00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:24.149
If you also have files scattered across your hard drive or in the cloud,

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.879
I hope this training will help you.

10
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.840
Throughout this module,

11
00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:31.659
you will learn about the importance of standardized file naming conventions.
